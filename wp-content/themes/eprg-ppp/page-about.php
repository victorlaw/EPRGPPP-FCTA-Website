						<h3>History</h3>
						<h5>FCT IN PERSPECTIVE</h5>
						<p>
							The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) was created on 5th February 1976, through the promulgation of Decree No. 6 of 1976, by the Federal Military Government, culminating in the establishment of the Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA) and six (6) Area Councils namely, Abaji, Bwari, Kuje, Gwagwalada, Kwali, and Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC) and the satellite towns.
						</p>

						<p>
							The FCDA, under Decree 6 of 1976, is charged with the responsibility of planning, development and administration of the Federal Capital City (FCC) and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). This subsequently led to the creation of the Ministry of Federal Capital Territory (MFCT) through Gazette No. 55, Vol. 66 of 26th October 1976. The MFCT was responsible for the administration of the FCT, control of development in the Territory, provision of social services and infrastructure as well as land allocation and development.
						</p>

						<h5>The FCT Administration</h5>

						<p>
							Pursuant to the general objectives of the Federal Government’s reforms and restructuring of the FCT government machinery, the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) was created on 31st December 2004, under Order No. 1 of 2004, to administer the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), following the abolition of the Ministry of Federal Capital Territory (MFCT). Headed by a Minister and a Minister of State, who are appointed by the President, the day-to-day administration and management of the FCTA is the responsibility of the Permanent Secretary as the chief accounting officer of the Administration.
						</p>

						<p>
							The FCTA consists of Secretariats, Departments, and Agencies (SDAs) with eight (8) Mandate Secretariats: Health and Human Services, Agriculture and Rural Development, Transport, Education, Social Development, Legal, Area Councils Services, as well as the newly created Economic Planning, Revenue Generation and Public-Private Partnership (EPRG-PPP) Secretariat. The Secretariats are headed by non-career civil servants for administrative convenience.
						</p>

						<h5>Economic Planning, Revenue Generation and Public-Private Partnership Secretariat (EPRG-PPP)</h5>

						<p>
							The Economic Planning, Revenue Generation and Public-Private Partnership (EPRG-PPP) Secretariat was created on ….2021, by President Muhammadu Buhari through the recommendation of the Honourable Minister of the FCT, Mallam Muhammad Musa Bello. Carved out of the former Department of Economic Planning, Research and Statistics (EPRS), the new Secretariat, under the Mandate of the pioneer Secretary, Hon. Agboola Lukman Dabiri, is charged with the responsibility of ensuring the effective planning and transformation of the economy of the FCT through effective revenue generation and public-private partnership(PPP) model.
